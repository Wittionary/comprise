    <h1>"is comprised of" is invalid</h1><br>
    Comprise means "is composed of" so using the phrase "is comprised of" is like saying "is is composed of of".

    CORRECT:
    America comprises fifty states.
    America is composed of fifty states.
    
    INCORRECT:
    America is comprised of fifty states.
